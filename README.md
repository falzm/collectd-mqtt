collectd-mqtt
=============

This is my unfinished attempt to produce a MQTT write plugin for [collectd][0]
using the [Mosquitto][1] library. Due to a lack of time I never managed to get
the project to move forward.

I'm not a professional developer â€“ even less C developer, so expect this code to
be bad. Probably really bad. You've been warned.
